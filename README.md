- **Data**  
  _Describable Textures Dataset_ in **[Describing Textures in the Wild (Cimpoi et al., 2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3618)** -- **DTD** from now on.  
  In `/data` you can find the texture images reported in the paper (`blotchy.jpg`, `matted.png`, `scaly.png`, `striped.png`) and the image `pebbles.jpg` from **[Texture synthesis using convolutional neural networks (Gatys et al., 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07376)**.
- **Models**
  All models are available on Torchvision:

  VGG16 = vgg16_bn-6c64b313.pth
  VGG19 = vgg19_bn-c79401a0.pth
- **Image optimization and feature extraction**  
  Synthesize one texture sample from the images in `/data` by running `/jobs/par_optim_test.py`.  
  Synthesize one texture sample from each image in DTD by running `jobs/par_optim.sh` as `sbatch par_optim.sh reco`.  
  Extract features from DTD images with one forward pass running `sbatch par_optim.sh orig`.  

- **Analyses**  
  Find the pipeline of our analyses in `/analyses`. The following scripts work on the features extracted as per the previous point.  
  `/analyses/rsa_gram.py` performs Representational Similarity Analysis: run with `/jobs/sbatch par_rsa.sh`.  
  `/analyses/mutual_info_estimate.py` computes Mutual Information: run with `/jobs/sbatch mutual_info_estimate.sh`.  
  `/analyses/brainscore_correlations.py` performs correlation against **[BrainScore (Schrimpf et al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06161)**: run with `jobs/sbatch brainscore_corr.sh`.  
  Notes: `/analyses/dataloader_dtd.py` and `/analyses/dataloader_gaussian.py` contain two dataloaders as a standard pipeline to deal with data in PyTorch and Torchvision.
